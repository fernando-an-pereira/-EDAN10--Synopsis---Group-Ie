\section{Topic}
In this work, we will discuss about the introduction of SCM in a company, that is really relevant due the increasing of productivity that the SCM may induce in a  software development corporation.

\section{Problem statement}

\section{Hypotheses}
Software configuration management must be considered in all software projects and companies as it eases the general wrokflow and increases maintenance of different project parts. Well defined SCM activities and standards should be conducted upon applying SCM. As a result a good structured SCM plan should be used and set at the begining in order to avoid unwanted problems in the future. A software company that does not use SCM might thus face many obstacles which results in more financial and technical costs and might decrease project performance and delay the delievery of company's product. 

This paper shall investigate and explain how SCM can be applied to a software company that does not use SCM at all. Main SCM parts that shall be introduced into the company are configuration identification, configuration change management and configuration auditing. The result of this work shall be a SCM plan that describes the standards that shall be used in the company. It is furthermore assumed that the company has never used SCM before but is willing to do so and the management is looking forward to apply different SCM practices. The company has encountered different management problems specially during development of its products and is aware of the severeness of such problems. These hard impacts made the company management decide to introduce SCM.
